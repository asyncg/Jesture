# Jesture

Jesture – my best attempt at wordplay and my first dive into computer vision
(well after all those projects that I hate to see the code of and would love to destroy from my memory)

It aims to be a python daemon that lets you tie your scripts to specific hand gestures.
No need to stress about the nitty-gritty of gesture recognition – Jesture handles all that jazz for you.
Just define your moves, link them to your scripts, and let Jesture do the rest, Your Majesty.
